Data science project - Analyzing-Insights-for-Environmental-Monitoring-Using-Python-MySQL
## Project Description
This project help us to understand how to use SQL to analyze a real-world database, how to extract the most useful information from the dataset, how to pre-process the data using Python for improved performance, and how to use a structured query language to retrieve useful information from the database.
## Data Source
Data was provided by HiCounselor.

##Module 1: Data Preprocessing using python:

Data Pre-processing is one of the important steps in data analytics because data that is not processed can lead to different unwanted results when the data will be used for further applications. This task includes sub-tasks such as handling null values, deletion or transformation of irrelevant values, datatype transformation, removing duplicates, etc

* Task 1 : Reading the Data from CSV:
  The function read_data_from_csv() reads the data from a CSV file named 'iot_telemetry_data.csv' using the pandas library. It returns the DataFrame containing the loaded data.
